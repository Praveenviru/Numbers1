In the index.js  file i separated even and odd numbers from
the given array.i made 2 arrays one is even and odd.
I took for loop and i repeat there positions from 0 to length-1 of their random
array.Then,In the loop i added if condition if(i%2==0)then print even numbers in string "Even".
else print in odd string .

In app.js file i found prime numbers from random numbers array
by using a condition--If the number has 2 factors then print in Prime string.2
factors it shuld be divisible by number itself and 1.
